## Education background
Hi! I am an research assistant at Computer Science and Engineering, Westlake University in Hangzhou under my advisor [Prof. Yaochu Jin](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/yaochu-jin.html). I received my Master's degree in Engineering from College of Mechanical Engineering, Zhejiang University in 2024 under my advisor [Prof. Canjun Yang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/ycj) and [Prof. Wei Yang](https://www.labxing.com/profile/121680). 

## Research experience
While at Zhejiang University, my research interests were flexible exoskeleton and locomotion tracking. These areas allowed me to combine my passion for computational methods with real-world rehabilitation challenges.

Currently, I find myself increasingly drawn to the exciting realm of humanoid robot. As the population ages, I aspire to contribute to the development of general-purpose humanoid robots in the field of elderly care. If you have ideas or projects that align with these interests, please do not hesitate to connect with me. I am always open to collaboration and eager to learn from others in this vibrant community.
