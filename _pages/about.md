## Education background
Hi! I am a postdoc at Schoole of Engineering, Westlake University in Hangzhou under my advisor [Prof. Yaochu Jin](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/yaochu-jin.html). I received my PhD in engineering from College of Biosystems Engineering and Food Science, Zhejiang University in 2024 under my advisor [Prof. Fang Cheng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/fcheng). From January 2023 to January 2024, I was a full-time visiting PhD student at the Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore under my advisor [Prof. Sam F. Y. Li](https://www.samlilab.com/).

## Research experience
While at Zhejiang University, my research interests were rooted in explainable machine learning applied to nano-plant-environment interactions and nano-enabled agriculture. These areas allowed me to combine my passion for computational methods with real-world agricultural challenges.

During my time at the National University of Singapore, I expanded my expertise by exploring the integration of explainable machine learning with metabolomics and environmental chemistry. This exploration was a fascinating journey into understanding complex biological and chemical processes through data-driven insights.

Currently, I find myself increasingly drawn to the exciting realm of AI for Science. Witnessing how artificial intelligence is reshaping scientific research, I aspire to contribute to this evolving landscape. If you have ideas or projects that align with these interests, please do not hesitate to connect with me. I am always open to collaboration and eager to learn from others in this vibrant community.
